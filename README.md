Pythia, named after the Greek priestess symbolizing guidance and clarity, is a chatbot designed to help users categorize waste into compost, recyclables, or landfill. Built using Python Flask, OpenAIâ€™s API, and Gumloop for seamless integration, it processes user prompts or images to provide concise waste disposal guidance. Despite challenges in AI training and system integration, we successfully created an AI-powered tool with a user-friendly interface and a focus on sustainability. Through this project, we learned about AI prompt engineering, backend optimization, and the value of teamwork. 
Pythia represents a step toward merging technology and sustainability for a healthier planet.
